# panterasbox

This branch is just a place for me to stash code that's not for anything in particular. Here's what's in it at the moment:

* cell-manager/: A dashboard for managing Endeca search cells. It won't run without a bunch of wsgc.com libraries, but it's a good example of what a ZK app looks like.
* eotl/: Just a bunch of LPC code I wrote for eotl.org. 
  * eotl/condos/: Player-owned condos for Eternal City. Everything but the front office needs still needs descriptions, but the rest of the facility works, including a fully featured elevator and dynamic hallways.
  * eotl/games/: Some board games and such: Set, Mastermind, Minesweeper, Stratego, and Shift-Connect 4 (a 4x4 version of Shift-Tac-Toe). Some of the earliest code I ever wrote.
  * eotl/ratelimit/: A rate limiter to deal with DOS attacks and such. It works, but was never tuned and put into active use.
  * eotl/stuff/: StuffCode, a Nethack-inspired framework for potions, scrolls, et al. Just the base code, no implementations.
  * eotl/tpa/: The EotL Teleport Authority, a standard game system for fast travel between areas. 
    * eotl/tpa/station: The Eternal City TPA Station, a TPA waypoint.
* restsample/: A sample Spring 4 REST service I wrote for a job interview. Provides basic CRUD operations and has unit tests and stuff.
* scripts/: Where I stash utility scripts I write.
* spotify/: Playing with Spotify.
