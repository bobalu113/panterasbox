    To get tomcat up and running, you'll need to copy admin.xml and admin-sample.xml
    into the correct configuration directory for your tomcat installation and
    then modify the paths and passwords so that they are correct for the server
    you're pointing to.

    For developers using windows and the devtools2008 package, and who have
    checked out the dp source from the shortcut location from:

        https://thevault/svn/shortcuts/evolution/trunk

    into C:\Projects\ecommerce, the following pathnames should be correct and
    the developer will only need to fill in the proper passwords for LDAP and
    the database connection.
