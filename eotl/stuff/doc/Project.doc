If you can't already tell, one of the goals of the project was to make it as
easy for wizards to get these items online as possible.  The directory
containing the basecode, as well as the loading directories for all the
individual stuff items is /z/n/stuff.  I have given wizards complete read
and write access to that directory.  If you guys abuse that access, it'll
make me very, very sad.  The freedom is for wizards' sake, not mine.  I'm
not going to try to enforce any rules because its not realistic, but here's
some general guidelines you might want to follow to prevent getting your ass
kicked:

  * Put your name on all the code you write.
  * Don't touch anyone's code except yours.  If there's something you
    think shound be changed, talk to the coder.
  * Don't touch ANYTHING in /z/n/stuff/base/.  Yes, you have access to
    it.  If you have an idea you'd like to install, talk to someone
    important first.
  * Backup all your code.  This is a public dir, anything can happen.
  * Don't put anything in /z/n/stuff that isn't ready to go online.
  * Before you install a new item, have some people check it out first.
    I'm not going to set up some StuffReviewJunta or anything, but just
    use some common sense.  It's pretty easy to spot a bullshit item.
  * If you have an idea that you want to code, find out if someone else
    is already coding it.
  * Put all your objects in the right place.  Here's a breakdown of the
    /z/n/stuff/ directory tree to help you:
    base/     - All the core inheritables, as well as the StuffServer.
    potions/  
    scrolls/
    amulets/
    rings/    - The objects in these dirs will automatically be registered
                with the StuffServer when the mud loads.  These dirs 
                should contain the stuff objects themselves and nothing 
                else.  There's an FCS dir here if you want to use it, but 
                there shouldn't be any logs, backups, or support objects 
                here.  If your object isn't ready to go online, don't put 
                it here.
    support/  - Any objects you need to support the stuff you code (ie. 
                bonus objects, shadows) go here.
    inc/      - Include directory containing the global.h header file which 
                defines all the StuffCode macros.
    docs/     - Text files and documentation.
    logs/     - Record log files here.
    tmp/      - Just another dir you have write access to for whatever 
                purpose you need it to serve (ie. offlining or testing 
                something).


Since all wizards have access, all wizards can contribute.  The purpose of
the Stuff Project is to get a lot of different stuff out in the hands of
players, without putting the pressure of coding an entire area in the hands
of the wizards.  If you're coding an area, that's good.  Finish it.  Few of
us have the time to devote to finishing an area, though.  That's where Stuff
comes in.

There should be something for just about anyone to do.  If you don't know
how to code, try writing down some ideas.  You can code simple stuff in less
than an hour, or something really elaborate that takes a week to finish.
It's pretty much up to you.  Even if you're completely useless and have no
ideas and can't code, clone up some stuff and bugtest it.  Very simple
things should take no time at all to code.  I coded a healing potion and
light scroll in less than 15 minutes.  If you have more time, this project
still gives you the opportunity to get really creative.  You may have an
idea for a skill or object you always wanted to make, but never had a place
to put it.  This is your chance.  Keep in mind that the project isn't
targeted at people who are doing major code production.  It's targeted at
the hundred odd guests we have here, who have wizard bodies but aren't
really doing anything.  If you're not doing anything because you don't have
an interest, that's your problem.  But if you're not doing anything because
of time or ability, I hope you'll consider maybe contributing to this stuff.
There are a lot of possibilities for anyone that has the interest.

That's what the Stuff Project does for wizards, but what does it do for
mortals?  Well the purpose here is threefold.  First, it will give mortals
some interesting, and potentially powerful objects they can use right away.
It's interesting because you never know what you're going to find.  "A
scroll labeled ESAHC" could be just about anything.  It could be cursed or
it could be blessed, there's always an element of hope, and there's always
an element of chance.  Second, it will draw them out of the high-traffic
areas and into some of the underused areas.  This placement of this stuff is
completely random.  It can go anywhere.  If a mortal is aware that a really
good item exists out there, he'll have to search all over the mud to find
it.  Third, it won't affect game balance [much].  Since everyone has an
equal opportunity to find this stuff, everyone has an equal opportunity to
score.  Mortals like to complain, a lot.  Whenever someone codes a neat
skill, there's always someone in some other guild to bitch about it.  This
project will add to the game, in a way that's hopefully very hard to
complain about.

Remember, the point of this project is to give just about anyone something
to do.  If you don't know how to code, try writing down some ideas.  You can
code simple stuff in less than an hour, or something you.  Even if you're
completely useless and have no ideas and can't code, clone up some stuff and
bugtest it.

There are lots of different ways this project could be really cool.  The
only way it can fail is if no one takes advantage of it.
