==[ ScrollStuff Documentation]=============================================

This is the document for ScrollStuff, one of the child modules in the
StuffCode package.  ScrollStuff adds functionality to the core StuffCode
module for the reading of scrolls.  It inherits StuffCode, so if you
haven't yet read the primary StuffCode document, you should do that first.
All the functions referred to in that document are available in
ScrollStuff.

In addition to the StuffCode core, ScrollStuff provides a "read" command
for users and set of functions associated with that action.  The syntax for
the read command is simply "read scroll".  The messages printed to the room
and the user are also provided for in ScrollStuff, but you may wish to add
additional messages of your own.  The rest of this document is a
description of the functions that make up the ScrollStuff API.


====[ ScrollStuff Functions ]==============================================

set( "read_delay", int );
   This combat delay will be issued to a player when he reads the scroll.
   Defaults to 1.

void read( object who );
void cursed_read( object who );
void blessed_read( object who );
   These functions are called when 'who' reads the scroll.  The code in
   these functions will consume the bulk of your coding effort, since they
   handle the effects of using the stuff, from beginning to end.  Only 
   one of the functions will be called, depending on whether the item is
   cursed, uncursed, or blessed.  After using the scroll, it will be
   moved to a containment location, until it can be safely dested (no
   pending call_outs or heart_beat).
   
int try_read( object who );
   If this function returns true, reading the scroll will be prevented.
   If you prevent reading, you will probably also want to issue some
   message to the user.

void read_signal( object who );
   This is called after the scroll has been read and the effects have
   taken place.  Here you might want to do things common to item usage,
   regardless of whether it has been cursed or blessed (ie. identify
   the scroll).
