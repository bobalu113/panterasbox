
==[ TrapStuff Documentation ]============================================

This is the document for TrapStuff, one of the child modules in the
StuffCode package.  TrapStuff ignores some of the conventional Stuff
features, such as blessed/cursed status or randomized short descriptions.
TrapStuff is functionally identical to our standard TrapCode, and in fact
inherits TrapCode.  The main difference is that TrapStuff will be 
randomly distributed across the MUD by the StuffServer.  If no one has
walked by a trap for more than 2 hours, the trap will be pulled and
redistributed elsewhere.

Like TrapCode, TrapStuff can be dismantled (if it is not hidden).  Upon
dismantling, the trap is pulled by the StuffServer.  This allows the trap
to function with whatever behavior is needed prior to actual destruction
(similar to other Stuff items).

The rest of this document is a description of the functions that make up 
the TrapStuff API.


====[ TrapStuff Functions ]===============================================

set( "trap_name", string );
   This is the generic appearance of the trap, such as "a dart trap" or 
   "an arrow trap".  This must be the first variable set for TrapStuff
   (and TrapCode) to work.

set( "spawn_limit", int );
   This is the maximum number of clones the StuffServer will distribute.
   Default is 0, which will prevent spawning.

set( "prevent_spawn", string * );
   This variable is set to an array of properties.  TrapStuff will not be
   distributed to any environment holding those properties.  TrapStuff 
   will automatically add ShopP, LivingP and ContainerP to any value you 
   set above. [Example: InsideP]

int do_dismantle( string arg );
   This function works slightly differently than regular TrapCode, in that
   the default behavior of TrapStuff will allow a player to successfully 
   dismantle any revealed trap.  The player will still suffer the trap 
   effect() if the trap is set and ready.

See the documentation for TrapCode for an explanation of all other 
standard trap functions.
