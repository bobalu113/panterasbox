Saw Willie Nelson at the Mountain Winery last night, some highlights:

1) Willie played the only guitar (besides the bass), and he's a really good guitar player! I've always appreciated him for his song writing and his comforting voice, but I kinda disassociate him from his instrument when I listen to recordings. 

2) Before the Willie show, Huey Lewis was the best harmonica player I'd ever seen. The guy playing last night though, Mickey Raphael, blew him away. He played a bunch of different styles and they were flawless. At one point he was doing these crazy legatos and for a minute I was trying to figure out where the accordion music was coming from, but it was just him.

3) Alison Krauss and Union Station opened the show. I see a lot of shows at the Winery and the opener is usually an unknown. Which isn't to say that's bad or anything, but an unknown usually doesn't really factor into whether the show was "worth it" or not. She was really good, though, so bonus.

4) One of Krauss's vocalists did the singing for George Clooney in _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_, so we got to hear a couple selections from the movie. "In Constant Sorrow" of course, but also Krauss's rendition of "Down to the River to Pray" which I've been listening to a lot lately, after hearing a killer performance of the song on last season of "The Voice."

5) Anyone that's been to the Winery knows that it gets cold up there and Willie played in a T-shirt the entire night. I know the stage gets a lot of heat from the lights but still! He's an old man! They get cold. All that rocking out must be great for the metabolism.

6) Tickets to his shows are usually the most expensive on the schedule, so I got bleacher tickets for the first time since they redid the amphitheater. I don't know if I'll do it again. I found myself shifting around a lot because my butt would start to hurt, or the the bench would dig into my leg, or I couldn't stretch my legs out. Bringing a butt pad next time would help, but I think real seats are probably worth the extra money.
