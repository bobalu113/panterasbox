Once again, I find myself looking for a job. Going to try to commit some of my thoughts on the process to paper this time.

It used to be that the main thing I looked for in looking for my next job was to be to learn something new. The reasoning is something like, "I'm a self-taught programmer, so if I'm going to keep up with the college grads I better make sure I'm working on stuff that is expanding my skillset." A couple things I've learned since then...

One, there's really no such thing as a self-taught programmer. Nearly every line of code ever written has been built on some other code that came before it. And behind that other code, there were other programmers. So whether it's a lecturer in a university, an author in a book, or a another programmer in source code comments, it's pretty darn hard to learn programming in a vacuum. Knowing this, you should do your best to learn from reputable sources, even if you're "self-taught."

Two, unless you're terrible at your job, you won't ever really stop learning. There's so much demand for new code all the time, the craft is evolving really fast. There's so much new ground to explore and such free exchange of ideas, that we're certainly in some kind of Renaissance; the only difference is that a computer program can spread from Florence to the rest of the world in seconds. All in all, it's a really good time to be alive if you're interested in learning to code. Actually, the hard part isn't learning new things, the hard part is remembering the old stuff. 

So if the focus of what I want to get out of my next job isn't education anymore, I gotta figure out what it is now. The first word that leaps out of me is "freedom."
