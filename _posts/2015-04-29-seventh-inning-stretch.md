More riots this week, this time in Baltimore. The Oriels are playing a game in an empty stadium right now. I'm realizing that if I really want to be better about posting to this thing, I  need to incorporate posting into my procrastination routine. I've been writing this essay on the merits of subjective reasoning in the interview process for my director, and I'm like 99% sure I'm gonna send it. The last section is already written and I'm pretty happy with it; I'm working on the top section now. If I do send it, I'll ask permission to post it here -- there's no IP in it so they should say yes.

The email is a response to some things that were discussed in our monthly engineering meeting last week. I've been feeling this urge lately to involve myself more in WSI current events or whatnot, so I'm finally pulling the trigger and breaking email silence. I hope it's not too long, but it takes lots of words to make an argument for something.
