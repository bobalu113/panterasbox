Another interesting conversation with Guido.
<code><pre>You tell Guido: what do you think about https://web.archive.org/web/20130202
         173308/http://nxhx.org/thoughts/manifesto.html
Guido tells you: well, for one
Guido tells you: this line: This is more important than any other social
               issue, because it includes all social issues. All of our
               global and national issuesbfrom increasing poverty, to
               climate change, to education, to a declining quality of
               lifebare economic in nature
Guido tells you: is dead wrong, as there are all sorts of things that cannot
               be economized in terms of scarcity and markets
Guido tells you: it's also a pleasant mix of technological determinism with
               no regard for things like the blatant lack of meaningful
               security in mobile devices or the fact that, anecdote aside,
               most human beings still can't afford them
Guido tells you: all that said, I believe in the general argument but I
               don't think it's realizable in the current political economy
               and I don't think it alone is capable of changing said
               political economy
You tell Guido: there was a line from it quoted in a book by Jane McGonical
         who works in the field of gamification and what she calls
         games-for-change whatever that means
You tell Guido: the quote struck me in a very idealistic sort of way
You tell Guido: While we continue to argue about capitalism and socialism,
         for the first time a third option is really possible. We can build
         a more sophisticated, dynamic, distributed approach to organizing
         labor and resources than has ever been attempted before.
Guido tells you: yeah that's not a third option
You tell Guido: what is it
Guido tells you: it says nothing about who owns the means of production,
               which is the fundamental question that separates capitalism
               (privately owned MOP) from socialism (collectively owned MOP)
Guido tells you: it's a second-order means of organizing resources
You tell Guido: hmm
You tell Guido: i suppose the wizards own the means of production
Guido tells you: mobile tech can tell property owner x to devote resouc
Guido tells you: but who owns what is unchanges
Guido tells you: unchanged, even
Guido tells you: and property ownership dictates incentive response and
               incentive creation and alignment
Guido tells you: so yeah
You tell Guido: property ownership is another thing
Guido tells you: well, it's the only thing if you're talking about
               transformative change
Guido tells you: everything else is 1+n order derivative
You tell Guido: you own your home directory and the data that it produces.
         then there are shared private resources. and public resources
Guido tells you: you don't own your home directory
You tell Guido: carved out by some kind of addressing scheme in our case
         respect to the filesystem
You tell Guido: why not
Guido tells you: unless it's stored on a physical machine you own and
               operate
Guido tells you: and properly secured
Guido tells you: unless you have that you do not have viable property rights
You tell Guido: okay we can maybe do that but if we can't, can we not
         legislate our way out of that?
You tell Guido: putting aside natural law
Guido tells you: nope
Guido tells you: you'll never get a body of law that recognizes true, core
               property rights around data that exist physically on 3rd
               party material systems
Guido tells you: never ever
Guido tells you: you can take that to the bank                 s
You tell Guido: make me understand why not
Guido tells you: walk back what data are in terms of their place in the
               physical world
Guido tells you: electrons tunneling through integrated circuts in a
               logical, organized way
You tell Guido: particles of iron/silcon
You tell Guido: or that
Guido tells you: so walk that back one more step
Guido tells you: where are the electrons
Guido tells you: where's the IC
Guido tells you: on a board
Guido tells you: where's the board
Guido tells you: on a machine
Guido tells you: where's the machine
Guido tells you: and bume
You tell Guido: so it's a liability thing?
Guido tells you: physical, tangible property owned by {set of actors with
               claims to ownerhip}
Guido tells you: not liablity per se
Guido tells you: it's more fundamental
Guido tells you: the EULA of cloud systems makes it perfectly clear if you
               can cut through the legalese
You tell Guido: okay that explains the what but why can't it be overcome
Guido tells you: whatever information you put into a cloud system is 'owned'
               by the actors that own the server
Guido tells you: well
Guido tells you: never say never
Guido tells you: but understand what you want is nothing short of a complete
               rejection of the western conception of property rights
You tell Guido: I understand it's revolutionary
Guido tells you: and that's just not going to happen without some serious
               friction in the form of dead people
Guido tells you: because there's too much money and ideology involved
You tell Guido: yes
Guido tells you: well, then there's this problem: any and all sorts of
               predictions or plans about the ex post situation when there's
               systemic-level violence involves goes out the goddamn window
Guido tells you: you might get a pro-information property right fight
Guido tells you: and end up with nukes flying
Guido tells you: there's no way of knowing
Guido tells you: so unless you're risk-favoring, the optimal strategy is to
               avoid revolution
You tell Guido: okay that's a lot to digest but last question, might it be
         inevitable?
Guido tells you: nope
Guido tells you: no determinism
Guido tells you: life is full of stochastic (random) noice
Guido tells you: the future much more so
Guido tells you: noice = noise etc.
Guido tells you: now, in my view
You tell Guido: but given a long enough timeline
Guido tells you: a much more important situation is what happens when you
               combine genetic sequencing with nanomachines
ou tell Guido: don't we normalize?
Guido tells you: which gets us some neil stephenson diamond age shit
Guido tells you: no, we definitely do not normalize
You tell Guido: statistics is the only class I ever got a non-passing grade
         in
You tell Guido: granted I took it "distance learning"
Guido tells you: 20 years ago it was ok to beat up gay people; 10 years ago
               it was ok to ruin their lives; 1 year ago it was illegal for
               most of them to marry
Guido tells you: yeah, stats is amazing but you need a teacher that doesn't
               suck because more so than most other math I've ever taken it
               runs counter to how evolution wired our brains to think (and
               for good reason)
You tell Guido: genetic sequencing and nanomachies are a ways off but we can
         model complex interactions (tuning incentives) in a virual
         environment right now
You tell Guido: re: muds
Guido tells you: haha nah we can't homie how's that working out over the
               past 16 years here
You tell Guido: what's stopping us
Guido tells you: you fucked over the immortal incentives and now only
               shitbirds code
Guido tells you: the complete lack of structure in power here was laid bare
               by the 2000 demotion-fest, and people picked up pretty
               quickly that their existence here was maintained arbitrarily
Guido tells you: that's the cost of flat organization my man
Guido tells you: bureaucracy didn't magically appear because people decided
               they wanted to make their lives worse for no good reason
Guido tells you: the whole point of it from its inception was to shield the
               people who get shit done from the arbitrary and capricious
               whims of those who spaz into the scene kramer-style and fuck
               things up
Guido tells you: to be honest I find people who are reflexivly
               anti-bureacracy as dangerous as, well, the trumps and hitlers
               of the world
You tell Guido: i've got a lot of thoughts on that subject but the question
         wasn't how things came to be
Guido tells you: don't know your past can't know your future
Guido tells you: that's some basic bob marley shit my man
You tell Guido: but seriously, what's stopping us
You tell Guido: from at least building a model
You tell Guido: even if it's intangible
Guido tells you: path depdendency, inertia, interest, and labor time-cost
Guido tells you: I'm all for it in principle
Guido tells you: but who's gonna put the time in for free
You tell Guido: me
Guido tells you: and
You tell Guido: I dunno you can't know your future
Guido tells you: you can estimate
Guido tells you: and take action to bump the odds
Guido tells you: action is key
Guido tells you: but 'knowing'? nah
