A while back my director at Williams-Sonoma asked for interview question ideas, and I started composing an email about subjective vs. objective reasoning in the interview process. I never finished the email, but I thought I'd post an excerpt for a friend of mine that's trying to distill his work history down into a single page and was looking for a creative way to do it.

This section of the email is where I actually offer an interview question that engages the interviewee to think subjectively about their career, as opposed to rattling a more objectively-minded list of accomplishments as most people tend to do. I wrote this specifically for programmers, but the core concept could easily be extended out to other professions.

> Before I sign off, though...an interview question for the subjectively minded.
> 
> In my other life, I'm designing a role-playing game to run on top of a gamification platform I'm building. The game is about software engineering; you advance your character in the game by doing things like code review, bug fixes, etc... When you first enter the game, there's a character creation wizard which asks you a bunch of different questions about what kind of character you want to play.
> 
> It's maybe not exactly what you were thinking of when you asked for interview questions a while back, but what it does is cast everyone who participates as heroes in a story about their role in the engineering process. A story in which you're also a character, by the way, because everyone that works on one of my systems is also, by nature, playing this game. It's hard to get more subjective than that.
> 
> Since everyone's a player, everyone must have at some point gone through this process of self-examination enforced by the character creation wizard. This can tell me all sorts of useful information about potential engineers. Information I can filter on. To illustrate, I have to tell you about one of the stages of character creation. There are four different character classes you can choose to play:
> 
>    Soldier: Starts in the barracks. For players who are duty-minded in their approach to coding. Their motivation is to follow orders (or possibly give them). Advancement paths could include an officer path for those interested in architecture and different enlisted paths for generalists and specialists.
> 
>    Student: Starts in the dormitory. For players new to coding, or those looking to expand their skill set. Would-be leadership might choose this path and eventually become professors and deans.
> 
>    Tourist: Starts in the hostel. For players uninterested in a structured advancement tract, or that like to code in a variety of different spaces. Might lead nowhere, but still appeal to contractors, or players trying to earn experience faster.
> 
>    Homeless: Starts on the bus. For players who are creatively-minded, or coders trying to market themselves as distinct from the other classes. Would-be entrepreneurs might choose this path, or engineers that have fallen out of demand. Advancement is more challenging than the other classes, but this path could potentially lead to bigger rewards.
> 
> The question is this. Which one are you? Wouldn't you want to know which one someone else is before you work with them?

So there go. Try describing your work history like it was a role-playing game. You might have different classes than I do, or maybe you want to describe a quest you went on. These are all things I've been asking myself as I actually try to write my game, because I actually think that's where our lives are headed. If you look at LinkedIn, it began simply as a place to put your resume, but these days its looking a lot more like a character sheet from an RPG. So why don't we just build an actual RPG?
