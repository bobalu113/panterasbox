Goshdarnit I finished the resume last week and didn't even bother to update this thing. That should tell you a little bit about where my head's been since then. I finished it like Monday night and it was such a relief to have done that I think I just wanted to not have to think about it for a few days. I actually started coding some stuff for EotL the following days.

Nonetheless, it's done so yay. I didn't really write a resume so much as fill out my entire LinkedIn profile. I did recreate it in a more digested resume format after it was done, but I prefer to just use LinkedIn.

By not having to cram everything into bulleted lists, I could write the whole thing more-or-less as a narrative in first-person, leaving off the technical details that took up most of my old resume. Well I didn't leave out technical stuff entirely, but I used them to express wider themes. Like I wanted to illustrate that Teneros was a job of "firsts," so I listed some of the new tech I learned to use there. Other job descriptions were devoid of technical information entirely.

I'm not real sure what kinds of jobs this is going to attract because it's so much different than my last resume, but I tried to be more subjective in talking about my experience because I feel a manager that's more subjective in their analysis might be a good fit for what I'm trying to do with my career right now. 

The other great thing about LinkedIn is it's a live document. I'm sure I'm going to want to make changes as the job hunt plays out, and with LinkedIn I can do that. How much longer till resumes disappear entirely? This just makes me more determined to bring gamification to our professional lives.

Anyway, here's the link to my profile:
