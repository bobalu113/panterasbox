    <p>I just made my first commit for Williams-Sonoma in like a month. It’s always really quiet there during the holidays, so I’ve used the opportunity to just focus on gabbo instead. Being able to just work on one thing has been great and it’s gotten me thinking about finding an alternative source of income. For right now though, I’ve got bills to pay, so back to Williams-Sonoma it is.</p>

<p>This isn’t my first go at keeping a blog, but I’ve got a little more momentum right now because I’ve been maintaining a blog for gabbo. The problem with the gabbo blog is I’ve only really been posting when I finish a feature or I get stuck on a problem. When I’m just in a hole coding, as I’ve been lately, I don’t have much to say there. Also gabbo is a project blog, not a personal blog. Hopefully this blog will kill birds with one stone. It gives me a place to stay more regular about posting, and also gives me a place to talk about aspects of software or game dev that aren’t necessarily about gabbo.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty happy with the github tools, and keeping the blog here means everything is versioned which is cool. Maybe I’ll even have code to post here someday.</p>
